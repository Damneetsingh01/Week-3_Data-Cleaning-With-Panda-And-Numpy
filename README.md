What you need to do?

    Dataset Exploration:

Begin by exploring the provided dataset. Understand its structure, column names, and the types of data it contains.

Identify any missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies within the dataset.

    Library Setup:

Set up your Python environment with Pandas and Numpy. Ensure you have a Jupyter Notebook or another suitable platform for interactive coding.

    Data Cleaning:

Address missing values by deciding on appropriate strategies such as imputation or removal.

Handle any duplicate records in the dataset.

Correct any inconsistencies or errors in data entry.

    Data Transformation:

Utilise Pandas and Numpy functions to transform the dataset according to the analysis requirements.

Consider creating new features, normalizing data, or handling categorical variables.

    Handling Outliers:

Identify and address outliers in the dataset using the Numpy and Pandas methods.

Decide on an appropriate approach, whether itâ€™s removing outliers or transforming them.

    Data Validation:

Validate the cleaned and transformed dataset to ensure that it aligns with the intended analysis goals.

Perform sanity checks on key variables and relationships within the data.

    Documentation:

Document the steps you took to clean and manipulate the dataset, including the reasoning behind your decisions.

Provide explanations for any transformations or imputations made during the process.
